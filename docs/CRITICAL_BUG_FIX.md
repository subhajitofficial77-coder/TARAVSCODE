# üêõ CRITICAL BUG FIX

This repository had a critical bug in the TALE engine edge function which has been fixed.

## Summary

**File:** `supabase/functions/daily-awakening/index.ts`

**Issue:** Missing `await` before `runDailySimulation(...)` call. Without the `await`, the function returned a Promise and subsequent property access failed at runtime.

**Fix:** Added `await` so the function now reads:

```typescript
const result = await runDailySimulation(currentState, relationships || []);
```

## Verification

- The `verify-deployment` script checks for the presence of `await` and will mark the check as passed.
- After redeploying the function, trigger it and expect a successful JSON response including `event` and `dominant_emotion`.
